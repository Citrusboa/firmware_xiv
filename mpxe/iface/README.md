# MPXEI
This project is an Interface for MPXE.

## Goals
While MPXE itself is great for integration testing, the principle could also be used as a validation tool. The dream scenario would be to create a kind of cyborg system where some boards are connected via physical CAN bus to a laptop that's emulating a bunch of other boards, while also displaying an interface for controlling said other boards.

The inputs MPXEI must enable are:
- starting a project
- stopping a project
-
