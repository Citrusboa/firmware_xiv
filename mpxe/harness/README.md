# Firmware Emulator
The goal for this emulator is to be able to run automated integration tests, as well as provide an interface for interacting with the firmware system.

## Usage
Protobuf-c must be installed for the protobuf generation to work.

Run `make mpxe`

## Todo:
- Implement CAN
- Create more meaningful output
- Add support for more drivers
