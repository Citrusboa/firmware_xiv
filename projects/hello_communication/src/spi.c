/**
 * Part 1: I2C

Based on the MSXII pedal board schematics, write a function that writes 0b0010010010100110 to the configuration register, then reads the conversion register.

Hint: youâ€™ll need to look at the schematics for the pedal board and the datasheet for the ADC.
Part 2: SPI

Based on the MSXII charger interface board schematics, write a function that initializes SPI then writes the following information to the CANCTRL 
register of the CAN controller IC:

    Set loopback mode

    Do not request abort of transmit buffers

    Enable one shot mode

    Disable CLKOUT pin

    Set the CLKOUT prescaler to System Clock / 2.

Then, send the READ STATUS instruction and print the TXB1CNTRL[3] bit from the return.
Part 3: CAN Communication

Write a function that periodically sends a CAN message with id 0xA and a random uint16_t as the body, and requests an ACK with an OK status. 
Write another function that periodically sends a CAN message with id 0xB and a different random uint16_t as the body.

Then, register callbacks for both that print the data, but only ACK the 0xA message.

Run the program in two terminals at the same time, and send a screenshot of the output to your lead.
